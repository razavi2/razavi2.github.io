Golbahar means "spring flower", it derived from Farsi word گل (gol) meaning flower or rose and بهار (bahar)  meaning spring. It is a symbol of new beginnings. Golbahar is located in the Razavi Khorasan Province, northeast of Iran. It is a planned city that serves as the heart of Golbahar County as well as its capital. Located 35 kilometers northwest of Mashhad and near Chennaran, it was designed to accommodate the growing population of Mashhad making its meaning "new beginnings" makes sense.

The city is strategically positioned, to the south by Binalud Mountain Range, to the north by the Hezar Masjed Mountains, and blessed with the flow of Kashafrud River. Throughout the years, the city has seen significant growth from 6,889 in 2006 when it was only a village and soared to 36,877 residents in 2016. The expansion was then followed by the establishment of Golbahar County. Golbahar, along with Binalood, becomes one of Razavi Khorasan's planned urban centers.
