Hello! We are a group of Spatial Engineering students from the ITC Faculty, University of Twente. We currently are working on Food and Water Security in Iran project. As spatial engineers, this project is an important part of our program since this lets us work on a real problem and thus providing us perspective on how do we solve real and wicked problem that affects real people.

It is a big challenge to give everyone sustainable and nutritious food and water. There are factors that make people struggle to find food and water such as international politics, climate change, natural disasters, and changing environment landscape. As spatial engineers, we want to help people in these challenges and find ways to do well in these difficult times.

We choose Golbahar City and its neighboring villages as our study area due to the fact that we see high Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), very low well depth, and low precipitation. The problem that we are going to address is how water is used and managed. Our solution is going towards the revival of Qanat system, a traditional way to manage water in Iran. Qanat system can solve water problem as well as become an icon to the people as it is a part of Iranian culture and history.

Our team consists of:
1. **Azzadiva Sawungrana** as Project Manager
2. **Mujtaba Qasim** as Geospatial Data Analyst
3. **Luc Meulenbroek** as Technical Research & Solutions Engineer
4. **Lisemijn Presser** as Socio-Cultural & Economic Analyst
